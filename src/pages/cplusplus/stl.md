# The Standard Template Library (STL)

STL is a collection of container and algorithm implementations built in to C++. These are extrememly useful in building your projects as they have correct, standard and efficient implementations of the siad containers and algorithms. Knowledge of STL is essential to ensure you do not end up reinventing the wheel.

## Containers
STL provides a range of containers to allow the storage of other objects. Now these may be **Sequence Containers** such as ```std::vector```, ```std::list```, ```std::deque```, **Associative Containers** such as ```std::set```, ```std::map```, ```std::multiset```, ```std::mutimap``` or **Container Adpators** such as ```std::stack```, ```std::queue```, ```std::priority_queue```.
